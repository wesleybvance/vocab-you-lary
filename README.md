## User Description

An ideal user is a beginner student in tech, just starting to learn the context of technical terms but faced with an extensive volume of terminalogy to learn at once, especially when learning multiple languages. 

The problem this app solves for the user is that it keeps user-specific terms in one place, and can be filtered and referenced by the context it is needed for. A user gets to choose what terms they need to be able to reference and sort them by the languages they choose. 


## Features
1. A User can view all vocab words they have created
2. A User can view all Languages they have created
3. A User can enter new vocab words by languages they have created
4. A User can edit existing entries 
5. A User can filter words by language
