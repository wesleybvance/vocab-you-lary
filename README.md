## User Description

- An ideal user is a beginner student in tech, just starting to learn the context of technical terms but faced with an extensive volume of terminalogy to learn at once, especially when learning multiple languages. 

- The problem this app solves for the user is that it keeps user-specific terms in one place, and can be filtered and referenced by the context it is needed for. A user gets to choose what terms they need to be able to reference and sort them by the languages they choose. 


## Features
- A User can view all vocab words they have created
- A User can view all Languages they have created
- A User can enter new vocab words by languages they have created
- A User can edit existing entries 
- A User can filter words by language
